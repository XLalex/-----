    "\n",
    "The call options we have considered on Google stock are in fact American options not European options. Typically options on an individual stock will be American options whereas options on an index are European options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google options do not pay dividends. In fact, throughout this course we have only considered stocks that do not pay dividends. (To apply the theory we have considered to stocks which pay dividends is to assume that one reinvests any dividends paid by a company into the stock of that company. One can then model the value of the asset \"Stock + dividend\" rather than model the stock price directly to obtain similar results.)\n",
    "\n",
    "American call options and European call options are equivalent for options which do not pay dividends if the interest rate $r\\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this\n",
    "it suffices to prove that at time $t$, a European call option with strike $K$ and maturity $T$ is always worth more than $\\max\\{S_t - K, 0\\}$, as this implies\n",
    "that there is no benefit to exercising an American option before maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove our claim we use a replication argument:\n",
    "* If you have $S_t-K$ cash at time $t$, you could purchase one unit of stock and put $-K$ in the risk-free account. At time $T$ this will be worth $S_T-e^{r(T-t)}K$. So having $S_t-K$ cash at time $t$ allows you to replicate $S_T-e^{r(T-t)}K$. Hence the price of a derivative with payoff\n",
    "$S_T-e^{r(T-t)}K$ must be $S_t-K$.\n",
    "* But $\\max\\{S_T-K,0\\} \\geq S_T - K \\geq S_T - e^{r(T-t)}K$ since $r \\geq 0$. So a European call option with strike $K$ and maturity $T$ is always worth more than a derivative with payoff $S_T - e^{r(T-t)}K$, and so it is always worth more than $S_t-K$.\n",
    "* Since the payoff of a European call option is always non-negative, European call options must be worth at least $0$ too.\n",
    "* Hence at time $t$, a European call option with strike $K$ and maturity $T$ is always worth more than $\\max\\{S_t-K,0\\}$ as claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you can price American call options in the Black-Scholes model using the Black-Scholes formula. However, American put options are trickier to price in the Black-Scholes model."
