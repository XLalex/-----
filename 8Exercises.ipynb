    "Since these derivatives measure the sensitivity to market changes, they can be viewed as a form of risk-figure. One advantage they have as risk figures is that you can compute the Greeks of a portfolio just by adding up the Greeks of its components. This is because partial derivatives are linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a trader writes (i.e. sells) a call option and replicates it using the delta-hedging strategy, then the delta of their portfolio is 0 at all times. This is because their portfolio consists of $-1$ units of the option and $\\Delta$ units of the stock. So the total $\\Delta$ is $-1 \\cdot  \\Delta + 1 \\cdot \\Delta=0$, since the $\\Delta$ of the stock is 1 ($\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial S}=1$). So the $\\Delta$ hedging strategy can be viewed\n",
    "as the strategy of ensuring that this particular risk-measure is always 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, derivatives traders manage their portfolios to ensure that most of the Greek's are low as, at least heuristically, one would then expect that the portfolio is hedged against risks such as a change in interest rate or volatility."

Hence one can start with an initial wealth of $0$ to obtain a guaranteed payoff of $e^{rT}(V-W)$ by putting $(V-W)$ into the risk-free bank account and following the two replication strategies with the starting wealth $W-V$. If $V-W>0$ this would be an arbitrage strategy. If $V-W<0$, following essentially the same strategy but with opposite signs will yield an arbitrage. So the existence of two replication strategies with different prices contradicts the assumption that there is no arbitarge."
